# Welcome to the Date Field package! 📅

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/date_field.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/date_field)

This package provides two widgets, DateTimeField and DateTimeFormField, which allow users to pick a
date and/or time from an input field. You can customize the appearance of the widgets using the
decoration argument, and specify whether to ask for a date, a time, or both using the mode
parameter. You can further customize the picker by configuring dialog properties.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Add date_field package to your dependencies in pubspec.yaml.
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     ...
     date_field: ^5.2.0
   ```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
3. Initialize your systems locale. If not, users might see AM/PM even when
   they configured their system to use 24h format. Add the following code to your main function:

   ```dart
   import 'package:intl/intl_standalone.dart' if (dart.library.html) 'package:intl/intl_browser.dart';

   Future<void> main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await findSystemLocale();
     runApp(const MyApp());
   }
   ```
4. Import the package in your Dart code.
   ```dart
   import 'package:date_field/date_field.dart';
   ```
5. Use the Widget. Example:

   ```dart
   DateTimeFormField(
     decoration: const InputDecoration(
       labelText: 'Enter Date',
     ),
     firstDate: DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 10)),
     lastDate: DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 40)),
     initialPickerDateTime: DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 20)),
     onChanged: (DateTime? value) {
       selectedDate = value;
     },
   ),
   ```
6. To display the adaptive dialog without the field widget, you can directly use the `showAdaptiveDateTimePicker`.
   ```dart
    final DateTime? result = await showAdaptiveDateTimePicker(
      context: context,
      mode: DateTimeFieldPickerMode.dateAndTime,
    );
   ```

_Note that you can also use the `showMaterialDateTimePicker` and `showCupertinoDateTimePicker` functions to show
the Material and Cupertino pickers directly._
